# GUI APP Password Manager
## *Description*
The code utilizes python's TKinter library to create a GUI app which has users
input their email/username while also giving which site or app it is for. 
Sometimes coming up with a password takes a while too, so the app has a 
*generate password* button. When the form is filled the user may submit and 
the app clears all inputs and saves the information in a .json file.
